# BigBand

Online tool for practicing Big Band trumpet solos.  Recommend using Chrome.

Each button is bindable to any key on your keyboard except Escape, and hopefully any button/joystick on any controller that your browser can recognize.  If you hate yourself you can do things like binding MP to pressing up on the left joystick.  Click on the buttons with the key name labels ("Numpad 1", etc.) to change the control.

You can enter in a series of comma separated "notes" into the big white box and select Start, and the corresponding buttons will be highlighted as you play the correct notes.  It's pretty lenient, any "u" or "8" marks that note as "up", and any "d" or "2" will mark it as down.  You can include any characters you want in between valid notes buttons like "LP" or "HK, except commas of course. Note: it will say mean things to you for now if your input contains something it doesn't understand.  This is temporary and it will be much nicer in the future.  The sequence can be started/restarted with a keyboard shortcut, default "R", which can be changed by right-clicking on the Start button.

## Firefox
I don't know why, but it sounds bad in Firefox when you play notes without a significant delay between them.  I use Chrome anyway so this is a low priority for me but if anyone knows why this happens or how to fix it, let me know.  Not sure if you can conteact through Github but send it to laharlsblade@gmail.com and I'll see it eventually, probably.

Disclaimer: The code ain't pretty and there's guaranteed to be bugs, too bad
